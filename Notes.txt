Linear Regression   
	Summary Table
		1) Estimate column is the coefficient (Weightage) of the independent variable
		2) Standard error is the error associated with that independent variable
		3) t-value = weightage / std. Error
		4) Bigger abs value of weightage is better
		5) lower abs std. Error is better
		6) p-value is the probability of coeff being a zero (i.e) No effect on the model
   
	Modeling
		1) Always remove variables one by one (So we can see the effect of removal of one variable on the other)
		2) When we remove one variable, the other insignificant variable may turn into a significant one
		3) R2 can never be more than 1
			3.1) R2 = 1 - (SSE/SST)
		4) R Squared is the squared correlation coefficients
		5) SSE is always less than or equal to SST

		Sensitivity = TP / (TP + FN)
		Specificity = TN / (TN + FP)

	Threshold value
		1) A model with higher threshold value will have 
			i) Lower Sensitivity and Higher Specificity

		1) A model with lower threshold value will have 
			i) Higher Sensitivity and Lower Specificity
